# Rhinestone Nexus

**Version 1.2.0**

A modular smart account optimized for multichain use with [Rhinestone relaying](https://docs.rhinestone.dev/home/introduction/rhinestone-intents).

> This is a fork of [Biconomy's Nexus](https://github.com/bcnmy/nexus), a modular smart account built off the foundational work of ERC-7579 and the [ERC-7579 reference implementation](https://github.com/erc7579/erc7579-implementation). We extend our thanks to the Biconomy team in partnering with us to build the foundations of ERC-7579.

## Overview

Rhinestone Nexus is an [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) compliant modular smart account designed for seamless cross-chain operations. Built on top of the battle-tested and heavily audited Biconomy Nexus, this fork is optimized to work seamlessly with Rhinestone's intent-based infrastructure.

### Key Features

**Multichain Ready**
- Multi-chain aware initialization with chain ID verification
- EIP-712 TypedData signing for cross-chain initialize transactions
- Designed for use with Rhinestone Intents for cross-chain execution

**EIP-7702 Native Support**
- Full support for [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) accounts
- PREP (Provably Rootless EIP-7702 Proxy) implementation for relay-friendly account initialization
- Enables EOAs to delegate to smart account logic without deploying a proxy

**Composable Execution**
- `executeComposable()` for multi-transaction orchestration
- Supports complex execution flows for intent settlement
- Integrated with the modular validator, executor, and hook system

**Enhanced Module System**
- Pre-validation hooks for ERC-4337 and ERC-1271
- Emergency hook uninstall mechanism with timelock protection
